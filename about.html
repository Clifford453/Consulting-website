    <h2>About Universal Consulting.</h2>
    <p>
      Universal Consulting is a results-driven Financial Planning & Analysis
      (FP&A) firm committed to helping small businesses not only plan
      effectively—but execute with confidence. We go beyond spreadsheets and
      reports to support the real-world implementation of financial strategies
      that drive growth, efficiency, and resilience. We understand that great
      ideas only create value when they’re put into action. That’s why we
      partner closely with business owners to translate financial insights into
      operational success—building budgets, setting goals, and rolling out
      performance frameworks that work in day-to-day business life. Whether
      you're seeking to improve profitability, manage cash flow, or build a
      forward-looking financial plan, Universal Consulting provides hands-on
      support from analysis through to execution.
